# 📈 Weekly Complaint Forecasting – Telecom Time Series Project (Python)

This project focuses on forecasting weekly customer complaints for a telecom company using time series analysis techniques. We apply three types of exponential smoothing methods and finalize the forecast using Holt-Winters (Triple Exponential Smoothing). The analysis is performed using Python.

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Statsmodels
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## 📁 Files Included

- `complaint_forecasting.ipynb` – Main notebook with EDA and forecasting
- `data_description.txt` – Description of the dataset columns
- `insights.md` – Summary of findings and forecast insights

## 📊 Forecasting Techniques Used

- Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES)
- Holt’s Linear Trend Method
- Holt-Winters (Additive/Multiplicative)

## 🕒 Time Period

- Weekly data
- Forecast focused on upcoming complaint volumes based on historical patterns

## ✅ Use Case

Helps the telecom company prepare operational resources (like support staff) based on projected complaint volumes, particularly around commercial events or discount weeks.
